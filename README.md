# Week-9-codepath
This Is Week 9 Codepath Honeypot
# Project 9 - Honeypot

Time spent: **16** hours spent in total

> Objective: Set up a Honey pot to be attacked and log the attacks

## Honey pots deployed

I deployed Three honeypots and an admin 

## Issues

Alot of my issues were just with getting gcloud to work just right and so sometimes I was confused on which commands to use where and also how to modify them to fit what I needed to do. Also figuring out how to export the json file was pretty hard and I almost gave up on it and then I figured it out.

## Notes
When you get stuck in this challege its really hard to work around it and figure it out because there is not that much documentation on mhn honeypots on google cloud platform
